●	To open and run a Node project, navigate to the project directory in your terminal, then execute the command "npm start" (or "node index.js" if your entry point is named "index.js") which will start the Node server, allowing you to access your application in a web browser; make sure you have Node.js installed beforehand and have a "package.json" file set up in your project directory to manage dependencies. 
●	Key steps:
●	Open Terminal: Navigate to your project directory in the terminal. 
●	Check Package.json: Ensure a "package.json" file exists in your project directory. 
●	Run "npm start": Type "npm start" and press enter. 
●	Important points to remember:
●	Entry Point: If "npm start" doesn't work correctly, check your "package.json" file to ensure the "scripts" section has a "start" script pointing to the correct entry point file (usually "index.js"). 
●	Direct execution: You can also run a Node script directly using "node filename.js". 
●	Dependencies: If your project has dependencies, run "npm install" to install them before running "npm start".
